## Plan: 6-Week Day-by-Day Newspaper Execution Roadmap

Build a bilingual (English + Bangla) responsive newspaper web app with Next.js 16 and Supabase free tier, including role-based admin workflow, publishing pipeline, categories/tags, image upload, social sharing, and print support.

- Security model validated via RLS and role tests.

**Daily Execution Ritual (to avoid getting stuck)**

- Start of day: pick day goal, list 3 must-complete tasks, identify blocker risk.
- Midday checkpoint: run lint/type-check and quick smoke test.
- End of day: write progress note, unresolved issues, and next-day first action.
- If blocked > 60 minutes: narrow scope to smallest testable slice and continue.
